<HTML>
  <head>
    <title> My Page </title>
    <style src....> # this is how you tell this page to connect to CSS
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <h1> A cool page </h1>
    <p> About me </p>
    <p> I like... </p> 
    <img src = "...">
  </body>

</HTML>

so suppose we are in CSS now 

h1 {
  color: #FF0000 (which stands for red in Hex); 
}

If i want to identify a specific paragraph, I have to put "hooks" in the HTML page so CSS knows that it is going there
