Hi! ðŸ‘‹

You've opened the IDE Sandbox. ðŸŽ‰

The Sandbox is an environment that you can access on "readme" and "code-along" lessons in Learn. It's a great place to experiment with code when you're not working on a "lab" (labs open the IDE In Browser).

The work you do in the Sandbox will be saved from lesson to lesson, and is automatically saved on your behalf to a repository in your GitHub account called `learn-co-sandbox`.

Please DO NOT touch this repository in GitHub, as it will affect your Sandbox experience, and potentially cause your work to be out of sync.

To learn more about the Sandbox, please visit http://help.learn.co/ide-in-browser#sandbox.

# GitHub is a code hosting platform used by millions of developers around the world for version control and collaboration. We are using what professionals use around the world!

# In-browser IDE
Autosaves
Integration with GitHub
Built-in terminal features 
Won't be able to rigth click files and open them on separately the computer
Not ideal for projects that are not already a GitHub repository linked to Learn.co 

# "Run Local Tests" = use their terminal to run tests on the lesson; must pass--will turn green 
To run test, type "learn" in the terminal 

# First lab: make an edit to edit-me.txt, save file, run learn 
Once you pass, run learn submit 

# Sandbox = Think of it as a scratch pad to test code and follow along
But this work in sandbox will not be saved 

# Use "git reset --hard" to get students back to the beginning, if they delete or breaks a necessary file. Remember to copy their work first
